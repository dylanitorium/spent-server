# spent-graphql

## THINGS I ACTUALLY NEED TO DO

- import new transactions only

## NEEDS TO HAPPEN AT SOME POINT

- don't create duplicate rules
- import transactions through the interface

## THE WAY IT SHOULD BE DONE

- change rules to a reference instead of subdocument so that they can be more easily validated on uniqueness

- criteria for which transactions should be be imported should be based on uniqueness of the transaction as opposed to date.
